          Iâ€™m pursuing software engineering as a career because designing and
          building computer programs allows me to tap onto both my theoretical
          and practical traits. I majored in computer science in college and got
          the chance to get my hands dirty writing code and learning how
          applications are made.
          <br />
          <br />
          What intrigued me the most was how much thinking and design goes into
          even the most everyday applications we use. In fact, I like to believe
          that the simpler an application seems, the more effort was spent
          designing it.
